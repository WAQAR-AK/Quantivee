SmartForm is a web-based form-builder that brings true intelligence to survey and hiring workflows. By integrating Google Gemini, SmartForm lets editors define a title, select key parameters (e.g. technical skills, communication, experience) and add any special instructions—then instantly auto-generates tailored questions with suggested answer types. Built on Firebase Realtime Database, it also summarizes and scores incoming responses, offers side-by-side candidate comparisons, and provides a usage dashboard for form stats. Whether you’re an HR team creating hiring assessments or anyone needing smarter surveys, SmartForm transforms manual form creation into a guided, AI-driven experience.
